## Diet Pattern Matching (Destructuring) Mini-Challenge :zap:

Clone this repo, open up [index.js](./index.js) and follow the instructions to fix the four functions.

**Make sure you only change the opening arguments of each function! Don't try to cheat the system, each argument is tested with more than one value.**

To check your progress run `npm i && npm run test` - if any of the functions are functional you should see some lovely green ticks. 

See [the Mozilla guide to destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) for a thorough introduction to destructuring.
